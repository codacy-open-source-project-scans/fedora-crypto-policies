SYNOPSIS
--------
*fips-finish-install* [--complete|--undo]


DESCRIPTION
-----------

possible to do so.


[[options]]
OPTIONS
-------

The only recognized and mandatory option is:

--complete:   The command completes the FIPS module installation and
                calls 'dracut -f' to regenerate the initramfs.

--undo:       The command undoes some of the FIPS module installation steps.
              Please note that module installation cannot be undone
              without reformatting of and overwriting, at least once,
              the platform’s hard drive or other permanent storage media.
              This option is not meant to be used in production,
              is not supported, and is implemented for testing purposes only.
